This is a simple introduction to matlab for image analysis. The codes used here require installation of image processing toolbox, deep learning toolbox. The first part deals with calculation of centre of gravity of a binary image. The file tsne_image.m illustrates the use of random number to create 3D array and 3D plot with scatter3. T-stochastic neighbourhood embedding (tsne) is used to visualise the low dimensional representation of the imaging data. the outputs of tsne are illustrated with 4 subplots, each created from different distance measurements.
